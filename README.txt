***LEGAL***

*DO NOT SKIP THIS SECTION AS YOU WILL REGRET IT LATER**

This script is not a script you should distrbute without legal permission, and that is for good reason! 

As soon as you double-click the installer, this will download the minimum files required to run python silently, download the script, start the script, and put 'rat.jpg' into your public downloads as a source image.

What the python script does:

[1] Copies 'rat.jpg' from your public downloads, and if it got   deleted, will create an empty file called rat.jpg

[2] Place a rat.jpg onto your desktop, and whenever you delete it, it will copy two more down onto your desktop. USE WITH CAUTON.

[3] Create a schedule that executes this script on startup of your computer.

IF, you download this, and you need to get rid of it, look for it inside of PUBLIC DOWNLOADS. it WILL be there, and it will end the program.


**FUTURE UPDATES**
#note, not all will be added, this is just stuff i would like to see in the future

A command you can run in powershell 'end rat' that permanently stops this program fro running

A faster download speed

Some other shit
